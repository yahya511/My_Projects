## The Problem:


I’ll be working for DataSearch, an employer recruiting agency, to gain insight into data science employment market trends. Recruiters, often known as headhunters, provide employment recruitment services to both companies and job seekers. I’ll be given the task of looking for trends in top data science jobs and their associated skills using a dataset of job posts.

## Market trends to watch

Job market trends are a typical supply and demand problem. The fundamentals of this notion are crucial to grasp, and we should keep an eye out for them in this case study.

## The data

For this case study, I’ll use a fictitious dataset made up of job postings in the data science industry during the last five years. Each entry in this dataset’s table corresponds to a specific job posting at a certain point in time, with 19 attributes or columns for each posting. Because this dataset is fictitious, we can’t apply any of the lessons learned in this case study to the actual world.
